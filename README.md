# sashay-away-website
Project for a Native.js course in school

I made a simple SPA to display icons from the series "RuPaul's Drag Race", with a quote-generator at the bottom of the page. All data was fetched from the No Key No Shade-api.

The objective was to create a dynamic web application that was presenting data from an API. We were to create a layout with html and style it with CSS.
We had to show at least 10 data-values, and we had to use events to make it interactive.
